# add-audio-to-video

## What does it do?
As of right now, this program takes in an audio file (.mp3 or .wav) and a picture (.jpg or .png) and will create a video for however many seconds (currently set at 60 seconds) at however many frames per second (currently set at 15 frames per second) then add the audio to said video. 

## Why?
I started to manage a [young phxraoh's Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/youngphxraoh/?hl=en) and had to create 60 second clips with audio to post. However, loading up Adobe Premiere Pro and exporting the video took a lot of time. Thus, I created a program that would take in the files and do the work for me.

## Downsides
The quality is different compared to Adobe Premiere Pro. I wouldn't necessarily say better or worse because it really depends on how you export on Premiere Pro. However, it is different. For example, the files included ("carnage.png", "YoungPhxraoh_Carnage.mp3", and "final.mp4") are the inputs and outputs of the program, with the .png and .mp3 files being the inputs and the .mp4 being the output. When comparing the Premiere Pro export shown in [the original post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CR4INkonvss/) to the "final.mp4" file, it is clear there is a slight color change. Also, as of right now, to create this audio file, not only is the final product created, but also a video intially without the audio named "videoOut1.mp4". There is an example currently uploaded

## Positives
However, when creating this program, I realized this program actually would allow people to post videos with their own audio without needed an editting software. Especially if it's a simple post like the producer I work with, it is definitely a solid alternative to paying for another editing software.
